# CMathCore

**CMathCore** is a C library designed for mathematical computations, providing robust support for vectors (2D and 3D), matrices, arbitrary-precision integers (BigInt). In future, it will include support for complex numbers, geometry, statistics, calculus, and series.  

The library is built with **performance, reliability, and portability** in mind, making it ideal for applications in computer graphics, physics simulations, machine learning, and scientific computing.  

CMathCore follows a **modular design**, employs **explicit memory management**, and uses **status codes** for error handling.
